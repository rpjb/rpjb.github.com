"What should everyone know about investing?"

This question was posed on Quora, and [Henry Wong](http://www.quora.com/Investing/What-should-everyone-know-about-investing/answer/Henry-Wong-7) had an interesting tidbit:
> In a probabilistic field, focus on process and not outcome.  Judge decisions not only on the results, but on how they were made.

In interpreted this in the following way:  If I use a strategy to pick assets to invest in, I can't simply judge myself based on the outcome of any single investment.  There are many reasons why a single investment may fail, but if the process reasonably implemented with discipline, over the course of many investments your outcomes will skew away from pure chance, reflecting the influence of some underlying stock market influence.

And then I thought to myself, that kind of sounds like science.  I perform a measurement of say a biological system. I assume that there is an underlying mechanism to that system. But, there are many reasons why a single experiment may fail.  But if I do the experiment the same way, over the course of many experiments the average result will tell me if my prediction of how the biology works is right.
