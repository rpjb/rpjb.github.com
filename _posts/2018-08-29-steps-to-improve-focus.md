Another productivity article from William Treseder on HBR.org:  [The Two Things Killing Your Ability to Focus](https://hbr.org/2016/08/the-two-things-killing-your-ability-to-focus)

> We need to carve out more time for ourselves if we want to remain focused and effective at work.

## Activities that reduce your focus
* Hyper-connectivity via mobile phones

* Meetings as a default form of interaction

On the second point, the author mentions a [Paul Graham essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) about the schedules of makers and the schedules of managers.  

## Steps to effectively focus
* Build up resistance to stress.  Calm yourself against stress of your activities and responsibilities.

* Organize tasks. Make your calendar, and be explicit about allocating time for focused work. Creative tasks in the morning.  Meetings in the afternoon.

* Clean up.  Reduce clutter on your desk.  Organize files on your computer.  Environment has an effect on your productivity.  This reduces potential distractions.

* Shrink meetings.  How many people are involved in the fulfillment of a project.

* Preserve buffers.  Running from meeting to meeting necessarily causes context switching.  Your ability to do this is worse than you think.
