James Clear has a nice [introduction to procrastination](http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiMjY2ODI3NSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNDI2ODAzMDczIiwidXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL2phbWVzY2xlYXIuY29tL3Byb2NyYXN0aW5hdGlvbj9fX3M9ZnN6cWJ3OG9teGNxd2dyaXNxY2sifQ) and how to avoid it.

Some interesting facts about procrastination:
* Socrates and Aristotle made the word Akrasia to describe procrastination
* Doing the work is often easier than just getting the work started.

Why procrastinate?  We tend to value immediate gratification over future gratification.  Perhaps this makes sense in an environment where you may not survive long enough to benefit from future rewards.

This naturally needs to the goal of moving future rewards and punishments forward to the present.

## Strategies to overcome procrastination

### The carrot:  temptation bundling
Do one thing you like alongside the task you are procrastinating on.
Example: Only watch your favorite show while doing household chores

### The stick:  introduce negative consequences for procrastination
Make an artificial negative consequence if you don't complete your task.  
Example: Gym classes that forfeit your money if you don't attend

### Preventative measures: commitment devices
Compel your future self to avoid procrastination.
Example: Divide your chipotle rice bowl in half.
Example: Automatically transfer paycheck portions to

### Make the task appear easier
Smaller habits are easier to start.  James suggests the 2-minute rule, new habits should only take two minutes to start.  Breaking down into small, trackable steps maintains momentum.

## Maintaining consistency in preventing procrastination
### The Ivy Lee Method
James advocates the Ivy Lee method:
* Each night write the six most important tasks for the next day
* Prioritize the six tasks by true importance
* On each day start from the most important and work until it is finished.  
* Repeat each day

### Why the Ivy Lee Method works
* Simple systems work best.
* Forces tough decisions.  Six tasks is a very small number, so you are actively filtering your tasks.
* Removes the friction, as you know exactly what you should be doing.
* Prevents multi-tasking, forces focus.

### Using visual cues
* Reminds you to do tasks
* Provides visual display of progress
* Progress improves motivation - "Endowed Progress Effect"
