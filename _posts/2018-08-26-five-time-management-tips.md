From Eric Barker on Time: [5 Secrets to Managing Your Time, Backed by Research](http://time.com/4129189/time-management-skills/)

Describes the work of Cal Newport, and the key problem he has identified:
> A 2012 McKinsey study found that the average knowledge worker now spends more than 60 percent of the workweek engaged in electronic communication and Internet searching, with close to 30 percent of a workerâ€™s time dedicated to reading and answering e-mail alone.

This pattern of work makes it hard for focused, concentration activities that create value.

* Schedule deep work, not distractions.  Schedule out your day.  Plan for days and weeks.  Block out deep work and fit in administrative work into batches.

* Keep score of your deep work time.  Make it easier to establish positive reinforcement.

* Say no to shallow activities.  Limit your use of "yes" to other requests of your time. Prioritize important work.

* Make a habit for deep work.  Building habits subconsciously prepares your mind for deep work.  Habits can start with simple steps such as clearing your desk.

* Identify how much time should be allocated to deep work
Need to be aligned with your boss and coworkers as to how much time should be spent.

Cal Newport's key quote:
> Focus is the new IQ.
