Notes for [James Clear's post: What Happens to Your Brain When You Eat Junk Food](http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiMjY2ODI3NSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzIzNzAzMzE2OSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9qYW1lc2NsZWFyLmNvbS9qdW5rLWZvb2Qtc2NpZW5jZT9fX3M9ZnN6cWJ3OG9teGNxd2dyaXNxY2sifQ):

### Conventional reasons not to eat junk food.
* Heart problems / high blood pressure
* Linked to depression
* Obesity

### Food factors that overcome those known cons.
Summarizes Steven Witherly's work (a food scientist) on why we like certain foods.
* Sensation of eating the food. How well are the taste qualities stimulated, the smell of the food, as well as the texture.
* Nutrient composition of the food. Combinations of salt / sugar / fat.

### Engineering food.
* Evoking multiple different sensations with the food.  For example, french fries, are crunchy at first, but then make a paste-like texture before ingestion.

* Salivary gland stimulation.  Foods that cause saliva to be released are more effective in delivering active tastants to the taste buds of the oral cavity.

* Fast removal of oral stimulation.  If you can clear food signals, the brain can be tricked to believing it has not consumed enough food.  Cheetos are a good example:
>  “It’s called vanishing caloric density,” Witherly said. “If something melts down quickly, your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it . . . you can just keep eating it forever.”

* Avoiding sensory desensitization.  Prolonged exposure to a ligand, or mechanical stimulation can desensitize receptors and hence your ability to report the presence of that ligand.  Junk food is designed to prevent this.

* Calorie density.  Junk food has an optimal energy density to prevent the brain from feeling sated.

* Reliable conditioning stimuli.  The smell, or sight of a familiar food will activate the memories of prior taste experiences.  Advertising, the packaging, and the smells can all re-evoke your memories.

### Steps to avoid junk food.
* Environmental programming.  You can't eat what you don't stock in your refrigerator.  Avoid junk food in groceries, which tend to be in the middle of the grocery.

* Choose variety for meals.  You can perform the same multi-stimulation trick by choosing several healthy foods for a meal.

* Stress may reduce your willpower to eat healthy food.  Acknowledge this and try to find other means to cope with stress.
