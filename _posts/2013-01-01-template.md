Nick Weiler has a new piece in the Stanford Magazine dedicated to the study of sleep ([A Bedtime Story](https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=72890)). Nick presents the career of the key protagonist, [Bill Dement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_C._Dement), in entertaining fashion. Professor Dement created the very first sleep laboratory at Stanford in 197.

Some interesting tidbits:

# We don't know what the "right" amount of sleep for humans is.

# 40 million Americans suffered from chronic sleep disorder (1992 study). 
 
# 24 percent of men in an epidemiology study suffered sleep apnea
