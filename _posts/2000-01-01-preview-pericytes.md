### Key players in neuroinflammation
- Microglia are resident immune cells of the brain
- Microglia and astrocytes proliferate and secrete cytokines / chemokines.
- Pericytes regulate blood brain barrier permeability

### What happens in the immediate 2 hrs after infection?

Two types of PDGFRb perivascular cells secrete the chemokine CCL2, which increases neuronal exciteability.  During inflammation, CCL2 mRNA is transiently upregulated, and CCL2 from these perivascular cells are the dominant source.

> Cell-specific deletion of Ccl2 in PDGFRb+ cells also rescued LPS-induced prolonged immobility during the mouse tail suspension test, a proposed model for sickness behavior.
