There's an article on Quora asking ["How can I determine what my personal basal sleep requirement is?"](http://www.quora.com/Sleep/How-can-I-determine-what-my-personal-basal-sleep-requirement-is) The short answer is 7-9 hours of sleep.

However there was an interesting answer that warrants some further thought:
> Scientists have found a gene that seems to allow some of us to get as much sleep as we need in as little time as 6 hours. But only 3% of us have that gene. Most likely you're in the other 97%. And if you're getting less than 6 hours, you are building up a big "sleep debt" in your body even if you have got the gene.
