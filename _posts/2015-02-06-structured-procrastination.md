> the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult, timely and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not doing something more important.

I found this a few years ago in graduate school, from a website called [structuredprocrastination](http://structuredprocrastination.com/blog/). Of course I was looking for ways to get my work done. The author turned out to be a professor at the very school I was at! 

I found a tip he wrote to be particularly useful:

> Fifth, make To Do Lists that break up your tasks into smaller ones, so you can get the thrill of checking them off.  

I ended up paying $25 a year for an online To Do List, using [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com). For me, it does make alot of sense.
