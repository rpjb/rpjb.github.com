James Clear has a nice article ([The Ivy Lee Method, The Daily Routine Experts Recommend for Peak Productivity](https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee)) about a productivity consultant that Charles Schwab retained to improve company productivity.  

Here is the method:

>During his 15 minutes with each executive, Lee explained his simple method for achieving peak productivity:
>
>* At the end of each work day, write down the six most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow. Do not write down more than six tasks.
>* Prioritize those six items in order of their true importance.
>* When you arrive tomorrow, concentrate only on the first task. Work until the first task is finished before moving on to the second task.
>* Approach the rest of your list in the same fashion. At the end of the day, >move any unfinished items to a new list of six tasks for the following day.
>* Repeat this process every working day.
