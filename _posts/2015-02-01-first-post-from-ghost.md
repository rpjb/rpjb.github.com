Ghost looks great.

It looks alot more convenient to blog.  I had been using Jekyll hosted on [Github](https://github.com/rpjb/rpjb.github.com) to create a simple static website.

The key advantage of ghost was simply the quick preview of  the output when drafting in Ghost. Jekyll does have a frontend called [Prose](http://prose.io), but there was a latency on the server end, that I found a bit challenging for the amount of typing errors I typically make.
