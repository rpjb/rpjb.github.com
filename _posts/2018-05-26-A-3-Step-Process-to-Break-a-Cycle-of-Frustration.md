[A 3-Step Process to Break a Cycle of Frustration, Stress, and Fighting at Work](https://hbr.org/2017/07/a-3-step-process-to-break-a-cycle-of-frustration-stress-and-fighting-at-work)

## Typical sources of conflict
- Incompetent boss
- Passive-aggressive colleague
- Resource-hoarding peer

Rather than focus on these external factors, focus on your contributions to your stress.
- Constant challenges
(Insufficient resources, moving goalposts)
- Toxic emotions
- Stress
While acute stress improves performance on routine, well-rehearsed tasks, chronic stress damages complex thinking, reasoning, and social skills.  Ability to process information, remain flexible to new ideas are compromised.  Start thinking in oversimplistic terms.

## Steps to eliminate frustration/stress
- Become aware of your feelings and reactions to stress
-- Identify situations that trigger your stress
- Consciously manage your emotions
-- Manage negative feelings, stop yourself from lashing out
- Don't view people as threats

### Mindfulness practices
- yoga
- meditation
- deep breathing

### Scheduled time for self-reflection
- reflect on what went well and what didn't
- don't fixate on what you could have done differentlyµµµµ
- reserve 20 minutes each week

### Practice empathy
- role-play what is the other person thinking about
- how is that person different of similar to my views
- what can i do to make others feel better about me
