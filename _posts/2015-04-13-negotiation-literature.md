Here are three books that help their readers navigate the process of negotiating.

[Getting to Yes](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0143118757), by Roger Fisher & William Ury. This book advocates finding win-win outcomes among participants. Description from Amazon: 
> Getting to Yes offers a proven, step-by-step strategy for coming to mutually acceptable agreements in every sort of conflict. Thoroughly updated and revised, it offers readers a straight-forward, universally applicable method for negotiating personal and professional disputes without getting angry-or getting taken.

[Bargaining for Advantage](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143036971), by Richard Shell. An Amazon review by David Landis had an interesting comment:
>  This is the best work on the topic of the information parties exchange as part of the negotiation process.

[The Power of Nice](http://www.amazon.com/Power-Nice-Negotiate-Everyone-Especially-ebook/dp/B00SEBEBSO), by Ronald Shapiro. In this book, Shapiro warns readers that winner-take-all negotiation may be effective at a given time, but the winner can subsequently miss out on opportunities for future business. Shapiro summarizes his process for negotiating: 
> Preparing better than the other side; probing so you know what they want and why; and proposing, ideally without going first and revealing too much.
