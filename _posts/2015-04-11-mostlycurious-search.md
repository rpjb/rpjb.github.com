Mostlycurious.com is a static Jekyll site hosted on Github.  This has been pretty convenient compared to my prior efforts, which have included Posterous, Tumblr, Ghost. One thing I have always wanted to include was a site-specific search bar.

This is not a new problem, and a quick search led me to a previously answered [Stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10131541/how-can-i-add-a-site-search-feature-to-a-jekyll-blog). I decided to try [Google custom search](https://cse.google.com/), because it seems pretty easy for a first attempt (see below).

On the web there is another good example and walkthrough from [Gleb Bahmutov](http://bahmutov.calepin.co/search-across-my-blog-posts-and-github-projects.html).
