There's a recent [article on the effects of blue light on our bodies](http://gigaom.com/2014/09/01/what-is-the-blue-light-from-our-screens-really-doing-to-our-eyes). The basic ideas are:

+ Blue light alters your production of melatonin at night.

+ Modern phones, tablets, laptops, and TVs have significant blue light emission.

+ Delayed production of melatonin are thought to correlate with insomnia, diabetes, some cancers, early onset macular degeneration
