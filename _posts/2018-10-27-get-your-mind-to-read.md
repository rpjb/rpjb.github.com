From Daniel Willingham at the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/opinion/sunday/how-to-get-your-mind-to-read.html):

Regarding a collection of Americans in 2003:
> Of those who finished high school but did not continue their education, 13 percent could not perform simple tasks like these. When things got more complex — in comparing two newspaper editorials with different interpretations of scientific evidence or examining a table to evaluate credit card offers — 95 percent failed.

Your ability to understand a news article or passage is very dependent on having an appropriate level of background information at your grasp.  You can make the correct inferences of the writer's intent.

Key lesson:  do not let lack of subject matter knowledge impede comprehension.
