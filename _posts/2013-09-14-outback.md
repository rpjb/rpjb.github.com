Ever since college in Champaign-Urbana, I've been a big fan of the Bloomin' Onion at the Outback Steakhouse. Nestled in the middle of nowhere far far away from campus, my roommates and I would go there every few months for dinner.

On a side note, this image was made entirely by OSX programs. Using the screen clipping tool, I took an image of google maps, and then put the clipboard into a new image on preview. Then I used their annotation tool, which seems very vector-like.

This was more than a decade ago, and calorie counting wasn't that big a deal back then. Fast forward to current times, and every restaurant in New York City now has some calorie range for each item on their menus. About two years ago I found myself in the Manhattan Outback to watch a Florida game I believe. Of course, we ordered the big Bloomin' Onion. But I was astonished to find out that one big fried onion was nearly 2000 calories!

And not to be outdone, are the chicken wings, another 2k of calories. Now I believe I shared the onion and the wings with one other person, and that was before the steaks we ordered. Since saving this picture of the menu, I haven't been back to an Outback Steakhouse. If I ever do return, I'm bringing 5 companions to share the onion.
