I often join public wifi networks when I am at a coffee shop or airport.  Sometimes, the very first webpage you attempt to visit is rerouted to a landing page for the WiFi provider for accepting some Terms of Service.

That can have the unintended effect of permanently rerouting a website that you want to visit such as Citibank, to Time Warner Cable (spectrum.com) on your Chrome browser.

There is a simple fix:
While the search bar displays the site you want to clear, on your keyboard type: `SHIFT+ENTER` or `FUNCTION+SHIFT+ENTER`.  This is in essence a fast way to delete your viewing history of that link.
