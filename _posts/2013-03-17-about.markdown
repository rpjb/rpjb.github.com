<p>I'm the main curator of mostlycurious. I'm a cofounder of sheepdog sciences, where we translate neuroscience research into tools and systems that can improve our everyday lives. I also do basic neuroscience research with Charles Zuker at Columbia University. I am originally from Oak Lawn, a South Side suburb of Chicago. I tend to like my job on most days. Find me on Twitter as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rpjb">@rpjb</a> </p>
