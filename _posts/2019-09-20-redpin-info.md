### Therapeutic Areas

### Ideas
Use chemogenetics to map out neural circuits relevant to disease.  Scott Sternson has a new class of ion channels that can be selectively engaged by an FDA-approved synthetic molecule called varenicline. If the ion channels can be expressed in cells of interest, oral doses of varenicline could have therapeutic potential.
