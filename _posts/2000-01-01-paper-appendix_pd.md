### Appendectomy is protective against Parkinson's Disease

### The appendix harbors a-synuclein in truncated forms amenable to aggregation
> We then analyzed appendix tissue obtained from people not diagnosed with PD who underwent routine appendectomies and found that they contained high levels of intraneuronal a-synuclein aggregates. The tissue was also rich in truncated forms of a-synuclein, analogous to those seen in Lewy body pathology in PD. Appendix tissue from healthy individuals induced a rapid aggregation of recombinant monomeric a-synuclein in vitro.

### The appendix as a natural harbor
> When we characterized the a-synuclein present in the appendix of healthy people and patients with PD, we invariably found an unexpected abundance of truncated a-synuclein forms, exceeding the quantities we observed in the substantia nigra of both patients with PD and normal subjects. Thus, a high degree of proteolytic turnover of a-synuclein is a likely feature of the appendix.
