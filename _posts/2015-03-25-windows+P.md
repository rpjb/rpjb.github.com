Windows 8 has a nice shortcut, that's actually been on previous versions, but I've just discovered:

`Windows logo + p`

This one shortcut, by quickly allowing you to toggle between duplicating and extending across monitors, simultaneously kills two of my annoyances:

* Ever had to give a presentation and not be able to control your presentation view? (perhaps due to some ATI or nVIDIA driver that overrides Windows native display control)
* Ever use Chrome remote desktop to a machine with dual monitors?
