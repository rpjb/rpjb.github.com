From a feature about David Sinclair in (Harvard Magazine)[https://harvardmagazine.com/2017/09/anti-aging-breakthrough]

Current view of aging from David Sinclair:
> When we’re calorie restricting, what we’re really doing is telling the body that now is not the time to go forth and multiply. It’s time to conserve your resources, repair things better, fight free radicals, and repair broken DNA.

The entry point to anti-aging comes from Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD).  Administer this to mice, and they become leaner and exercise longer.  NAD might be exerting its effect via the sirtuin family of proteins:  
- activated by NAD or nutrient restriction
- protect chromosomes
- maintain stem cells 
- inhibit senescence

Will be interesting to see how the nutraceutical (Elysium) and pharmaceutical (clinical trials) approaches compare over the next 10-20 years.  Getting a significant reproducible phenotype in aging, could take quite some time to run.
