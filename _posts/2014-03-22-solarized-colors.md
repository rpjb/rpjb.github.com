[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) has a nice set of colors that are optimized for your viewing pleasure. The colors are somewhat muted, but very legible, and easily distinguish text. It happens to coincidentally be very similar to a color palette I use for my presentations. ![My Keynote color palette](/img/posts/2014-03-22-keynote-colors.png). I also like having a go-to set of colors so that I don't waste hours deciding.
