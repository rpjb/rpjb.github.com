## Key problems of sleep debt
- We accummulate sleep debt.
- We don't perceive our resulting performance declines.
- As we age, our sleep shortens.

## Sleep strategies
- Be habitual with sleep times.
- Darker rooms promote melatonin function.
- Practice relaxation techniques.
- Exercise regularly.
- Lower bedroom temperature (65-70F).
- Keep a quiet sleeping space or use white-noise.
