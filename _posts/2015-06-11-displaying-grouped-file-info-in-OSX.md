I often want to check the size of a subset of folders on OS X.  To do this I use finder:

![](/img/posts/2015-06-11-finder.png)

The shortcut for viewing info in Finder is ⌘+I.  This is great for single files.  But what happens if you want a group of folders (or files)?

Result of ⌘+I 

![](/img/posts/2015-06-11-soloinfo.png)


To get the summary of a group try the following.  
Result of ⌘+⌥+I

![](/img/posts/2015-06-11-groupinfo.png)
