A new deal on [UrbanDaddy](http://www.urbandaddy.com/jt/hotels/22196/Spitbank_Fort_An_Island_Fortress_That_Thinks_It_s_a_Hotel_Jetset_JT_Hotel) has would-be luxury travelers vacationing in an old military fort on the English Channel. Back in the 1860's, this fort was built to protect Portsmouth from presumably invading naval ships.

About 1 million British pounds and 150 years laters, a quick perusal of the [Spitbank Fort website](http://www.spitbankfort.com/) shows a legit tourist attraction complete with amenities for corporate events and even weddings!  If you look hard enough on the site, you might actually get an idea of where it is exactly.  In fact this fort is so small, that you can barely distinguish it from nearby boats on the google maps satellite image (green arrow).</br>
