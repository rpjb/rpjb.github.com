From [feld.com](http://www.feld.com/archives/2015/10/deal-certainty.html):

Agreements in business can come in the form o mergers, acquisitions, financing.

"Deal certainty" involves the likelihood of actually completing a deal. Deals can fall apart at any time, including after a LOI.

### Activities that increase certainty
* Exclusivity period for evaluation
* Handshake
* Letter of intent
* Offer improved terms

### Counterparty characteristics that reduce certainty
* Comes from a different industry (with a unique set of negotiating standards)
* Large amounts of capital being deployed in industry
* Unsophisticated investors
* No prior deal history
