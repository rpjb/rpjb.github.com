On [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lumen-hack-your-metabolism-lose-weight), there is an interesting project by a startup called Lumen that has raised several million for prototype development.

[Lumen has raised >$7M]( https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/lumen-raises-7m-and-passes-1m-on-indiegogo-for-its-breath-measuring-device-for-weight-loss/) to develop a device that senses changes in exhaled carbon dioxide.
