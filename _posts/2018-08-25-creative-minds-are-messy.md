From Scott Barry Kaufman from his [Scientific American blog](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-messy-minds-of-creative-people/):

## Personality traits that predict creativity
### Plasticity
* Has a drive for exploration -> lots of dopamine
* Openness to experience
* High energy

### Divergence
* Non-conformist
* Impulsive
* Low agreeableness
* Low conscientiousness

### Convergence
* High conscientiousness
* Persistence
* Critical

The stage of the creative process dictates which personality traits are utilized.  Idea Generation utilizes plasticity and divergences.  Idea Selection requires convergence.  Mind has to be adaptive to the stage.
