doctitle: Why Facts Don’t Change Our Minds
docauthor: James Clear
title: Persuading With Facts Can Be Difficult
docquote: Leo Tolstoy was even bolder- “The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.”

Many interesting observations in this essay:

> We don't always believe things because they are correct. Sometimes we believe things because they make us look good to the people we care about.

> Ben Casnocha mentioned an idea to me that I haven't been able to shake: The people who are most likely to change our minds are the ones we agree with on 98 percent of topics.

> The number of people who believe an idea is directly proportional to the number of times it has been repeated during the last year—even if the idea is false.
