---

After a long hiatus, I have just started to look at Jekyll again.  I was a few versions back, and was unable to update the jekyll gem.  Using rvm, I downloaded a clean ruby update, and rebuilt with a current jekyll version.

Code snippets.  Pretty cool, uses a package new to me called Rouge.  I used to use Pygments.

{% highlight matlab %}
disp('This is matlab');
a = 'combinations of ';
b = 'strings';
c = strrep([a b],'str','th');
{% endhighlight %}

Over the next few months, the posts from the older jekyll blogs will be gradually migrated.  Also will begin to start exploring the new functionalities of the updated jekyll.
