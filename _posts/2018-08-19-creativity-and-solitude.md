docauthor: Jory MacKay
docquote: What Barron found was that the most creative thinkers all exhibited certain common traits.

## Build interruptions into your workflow
Graham Wallas:
> We can often get more result in the same way by beginning several problems in succession, and voluntarily leaving them unfinished while we turn to others, than by finding our work on each problem at one sitting.

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi:
> It seems that a person who is comfortably settled in the bosom of society has fewer incentives to change the status quo.
