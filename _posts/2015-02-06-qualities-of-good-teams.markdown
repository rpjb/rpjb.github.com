There's an opinion piece in the New York Times on [why some teams are smarter than others](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/opinion/sunday/why-some-teams-are-smarter-than-others.html). The authors, gave a large number of teams a set of real-world challenges, and examined their performance. 

Here are the insignificant factors:

* IQ scores
* extroversion
* motivation to contribute

Here are the factors that did matter:

* no individual dominates the group discussion
* number of women on the team
* ability to read others' emotions 

That last point is interesting, because the authors found the same results, with remote teams.  

>What makes teams smart must be not just the ability to read facial expressions, but a more general ability, known as “Theory of Mind,” to consider and keep track of what other people feel, know and believe.
