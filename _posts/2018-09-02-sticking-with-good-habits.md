Notes for [James Clear's post: How to Stick With Good Habits Even When Your Willpower is Gone](http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiMjY2ODI3NSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMzQ4MDgzNzI1MCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9qYW1lc2NsZWFyLmNvbS9jaG9pY2UtYXJjaGl0ZWN0dXJlP19fcz1mc3pxYnc4b214Y3F3Z3Jpc3FjayJ9):

### Environment has an effect on executing good habits.
Introduces the term "choice architecture".  Alter your environment so that it is easier to make the desired choice.  

### Willpower is an exhaustible muscle.
Willpower is a finite resource that is allocated to your activities during the day.

### Environment becomes more important when willpower is low.
When you have low energy or are stressed, you will naturally gravitate to easier choices. Organize and design your environment to align easier choices to good choices.
