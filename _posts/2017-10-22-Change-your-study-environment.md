What are some good study habits? Always one google click away, I looked around in the Internet and stumbled upon a few interesting articles.

Benedict Carey in the New York Times observes in [Forget What You Know About Good Study Habits](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/views/07mind.html), that there is a ton of advice on ways to study.

Here's the quick list:
* Study in different locations
* Study different concepts in one session
* Space the timing between your reviews of material
