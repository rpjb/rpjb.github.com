This is a great find by my co-founder Alex. There's a [Dell forum thread](http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19512174.aspx) that concerns new laptop purchases, that have rather smelly palm rests.

Comments include:

"tomcats litter box"

"cat pee"

"I thought for sure that the guy in the next cube who has a cat
brought the cat into work and it urinated on the floor"

"It's humiliating in class"

"a pack of well hydrated feral cats have used it for target practice"

"it's almost burning my eyes"  


And of course, the obligatory **grumpy** cat meme.

But don't worry, following standard forum protocol, there's an accepted solution. Kudos to Dell, rather than not acknowledging the problem (as to compared to say, Apple)
