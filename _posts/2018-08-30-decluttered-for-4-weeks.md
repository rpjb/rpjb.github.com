Excerpts from Tim Denning's Medium article:  [No Mess, No Clutter For 4 Weeks](https://medium.com/@timdenning/no-mess-no-clutter-for-4-weeks-f4ba42dbd83f)

Decluttering is painful.  Even thinking about decluttering can be painful because of how daunting it appears before you start.

But there are benefits:
> Now that more than 50% of my possessions are in either charity bins or at the recycling center, I now know what I can live without.

> Being organized is a massive time saver. No longer do I need to go on the equivalent of a twelve day Easter Egg Hunt to find a belt I want to wear. Itâ€™s now either the black one or the brown one.

Note that by decluttering, you a) have less options to deliberate on, and b) become more organized.
