Temperature is a key environmental factor in getting the best sleep. If it is too hot or too cold, people won't be able to sleep. They'll look to the cooler side of the pillow.  They'll twist and turn. It would be much easier if the room could alter bedroom temperature seamlessly through the night.

Withings has a sleep detector, and Nest has a thermostat. But both devices are not just the traditional hardware that have existed for the last 50 years. They have wireless communications, and can talk to each other.

So what's the software magic?  
> When Aura has detected that a user is asleep, it will send a notification to your Nest thermostat to adjust the temperature to fall between 64.4-68Â° Fahrenheit, the best range for sleeping. When Aura senses that you haven woken up, it will communicate this information to Nest so that the temperature can return back to normal.

It will be interesting to examine how users' quality of sleep improves over time with this system. After all, it is the ultimate test of this new product enhancement.
