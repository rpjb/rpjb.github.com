title: "Migrating from Posterous to Jekyll"
---
After several years of happily using posterous and it's easy email-to-blog service, I've been forced to seek alternatives as posterous will turn off later next month. This post is my first attempt to blog using Jekyll, a rather straightforward way to communicate on the web.

I'll be trying Jekyll out for a bit.  I basically took the instructions from the <a href="http://blog.apps.npr.org/2012/11/08/npr-news-apps-blog.html">NPR blog site</a>. Please forgive the bare bones nature of the site, we're under construction. And by that I mean, I'm figuring out how to type in markdown, and actually find some visual inspiration.
