Dina Kaplan has an insightful artice aptly named [The Cult of Busy](https://medium.com/thelist/the-cult-of-busy-bbb124caed51), which explores whether we are over-allocating our lives to busywork.

>  If your normal is busy, it’s tough to sit quietly with your thoughts or to really feel what you’re feeling.

Guilty as charged.  I find the NYC subway on the way to the West Side YMCA to be my only reprieve.  This will continue to be true, as long as there is no WiFi on the moving train.

Dina provides one simple task that I've distilled to leave the Cult of Busy:
> You could set reasonable goals for each day, then head directly towards them.

> If you’ve always wanted to read, find five minutes each day this week. Next week, find ten. Take it at your own pace.
