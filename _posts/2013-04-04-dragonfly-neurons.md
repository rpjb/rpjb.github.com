The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/science/dragonflies-natures-deadly-drone-but-prettier.html) has a writeup on the predatory abilities of a dragonfly.  Only 16 neurons are required for the dragonfly to track and calculate trajectories to reach its prey.

Interestingly, a dragonfly has four wings which confers extraordinary flight abilities. But, even when handicapped by losing a single wing, it is still able eat its fly food mid-flight.

One researcher at Janelia Farms in particular attaches electronic sensor backpacks to more finely measure flight trajectories and most likely in the near future, neuronal activity during flight.  Here's a three year old [talk](http://vimeo.com/16298313) from that lab.
