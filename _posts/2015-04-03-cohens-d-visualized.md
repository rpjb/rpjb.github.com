Kristoffer Magnussen has a neat blog about statistics and psychology at [R <- Psychologist](http://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/).  In particular, he has a very useful visualization of a metric called Cohen's d.  Even if you know what that is, it's very helpful to have a quick tool on hand without having to calculate anything.  All of the visualization appears to be made from [d3.js](http://d3js.org), which is becoming a standard for showing your data.
