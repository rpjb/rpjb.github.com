From Peter Bregman in [3 Timeless Rules for Making Tough Decisions](http://pocket.co/solstI?cta=1).

## Use habits
For decisions you know you need to make on a daily basis, you want to reduce decision fatigue.  Don't spend time on deciding where to get lunch.

## Use if/else logic
For decisions with unclear choices that you make on a daily basis.  Using predetermined logic helps.  

## Use a timer
Often times there is no clear answer at the time.  Save time by reducing deliberation.  Excessive data collection, opinion gathering, evaluating pros and cons all hope to give a clearer answer, which may not happen.
