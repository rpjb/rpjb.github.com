Here's a youtube video of an alligator trying to eat an electric eel.

It sure looks like the alligator died from electric shock, while the eel presumably died from a permanent crimping via aligator jaw.  And I wondered to myself, if such encounters are lethal to the eel, does it serve an evolutionary advantage?

Possibility 1: maybe the encounters aren't always lethal, and the alligator now knows for the rest of its life not to eat the eel.

Possibility 2: encounters are lethal, but passerby alligators rubberneck and now know for the rest of their lives not to eat the eel.

Possibility 3: encounters are lethal, and over the thousands of years, all alligators that have a taste preference for eels are killed, a selection pressure of sorts. Thus whatever genetic attributes that confer electric eel preference are removed from the genetic pool.

Not sure which is true here, but very interesting to me.
