doctitle: What are a few things that very successful people never do?
docauthor: James Altucher
title: On Underpromising
docquote: Everybody is told a lie - to be a success you have to under promise and over deliver. This is the worst form of lack of integrity. The idea is that you are “safe”. Let’s say you under promise and you under deliver. You think, incorrectly, “hey, at least I have my integrity intact”.
