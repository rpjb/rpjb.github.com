From Kevan Lee on the [Trello blog](https://blog.trello.com/time-management-tips-kevan-lee-of-buffer):

## Use the lean startup philosophy

- Take your big idea
- Find out the parts you don't quite know
- Build something small in order to learn
- Measure
- Learn
- Take your lessons back to your idea and start the cycle again

## Make a roadmap for your side-project

- Kanban: visualize your work load and limit the number of open todos in process
- Scrum: break down problem into smaller parts
- Sprints: time intervals for completing todos

## Automate work for yourself

- Use calendar reminders
- Use a side-project twitter account to follow relevant users

## Never set a deadline

- You are the only one managing yourself
- Side projects are meant to be fun
- Don't treat side projects like work
