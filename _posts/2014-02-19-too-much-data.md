![Resonate, by Nancy Duarte](/img/posts/2014-02-19-resonate.png)

I'm flipping through Resonate, by Nancy Duarte.  It's a guide to bringing out the story in presentations.  As an engineer masquerading as a scientist, I find myself looking at the data, rather than looking at the story.  

Well, [one quote](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/too-much-data-leads-to-not-enough-belief.html) that Nancy uses from Seth Godin, was particular insightful to me:
> The problem is this: no spreadsheet, no bibliography and no list of resources is sufficient proof to someone who chooses not to believe. The skeptic will always find a reason, even if it's one the rest of us don't think is a good one. Relying too much on proof distracts you from the real mission--which is emotional connection.
