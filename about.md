<p>Hello, my name is Robert, the main curator of mostlycurious. I was also a cofounder of sheepdog sciences, where we translate neuroscience research into systems that can improve our everyday lives. I used to work on optical tools to study living cells in graduate school, and continued to do basic neuroscience research with Charles Zuker at Columbia University. Currently I ply my trade at an exciting new biotech startup called Kallyope.  I am originally from Oak Lawn, a South Side suburb of Chicago. I tend to like my job on most days. Find me on Twitter as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rpjb">@rpjb</a> </p>
