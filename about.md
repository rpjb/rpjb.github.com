## Behind Mostlycurious
<p>Hello, my name is Robert.

I am a tinkerer at heart who spent my twenties utilizing  optical technologies to help understand living cells. After a few years of building tools in the Bay Area, I decided to take a deeper look into biology and focused on taste sensory neuroscience in New York. Along the way, I became a cofounder of Sheepdog Sciences, which aims to translate neuroscience research into simple programs and devices that can improve our everyday lives. Since 2015, I've been plying my trade at a new biotech called Kallyope.

My permanent home is in Illinois, although I haven't continuously lived there in almost 15 years.  I tend to like my job on most days. Find me on Twitter as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rpjb">@rpjb</a> </p>
